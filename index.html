                                            <p>Rabbi Capers Funnye is first cousin to Michelle Obama and Chief Rabbi of
                                                one of America’s largest Black synagogues, the Beth Shalom B’nai Zaken
                                                Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation in Chicago. Rabbi Funnye was raised in a
                                                conventional Christian household during the turbulent 1970s, an era
                                                charged with Afrocentrism and cultural separatism. Dissatisfied with
                                                what he considered a “slave master imposed religion,” he converted to
                                                Conservative Judaism. Rabbi Funnye represents the small number of
