                            Chutzpah—a word with many meanings. For the
                            nation of Israel, it denotes the fortitude and courage
                            to create a thriving society in the midst of the greatest
                            intolerance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Chutzpah has comparable connotations for the African
                            American community, as recent events show that
                            racial tension in America remains a very real threat to
                            the lives of African Americans. Every day, activists and
                            advocates fight for freedom and civil rights. As Calev Michael
                            Myers reveals in Crucial Alliance, this response bears
                            striking similarities to the Jewish community’s efforts
                            against anti-Semitism and violence.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This intensely well-researched book outlines parallels
                            between these two peoples that trace back hundreds
                            of years. From Jewish lawyers fighting racist laws to
                            Dr. Martin Luther King’s advice on an African
                            American–Jewish alliance, Myers stresses the
                            important mutual support and collective activism
                            between these two communities throughout history.
                            Broadening the perspective to Israel and its enemies,
                            Myers argues that ideologies like radical Islam are as
                            hateful and deceitful as the KKK and other violent,
                            racist terror groups.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We can’t stop now. Crucial Alliance calls for a
                            strengthening of the bonds between the African
                            American community and Israel in their shared fight
                            against agents of hate and intolerance.

                        <p class="red">
                            Calev Michael Myers is an Israel-based lawyer, human rights activist, and author. He founded
                            the Jerusalem Institute of Justice, a prominent Israeli NGO advocating for freedom of
                            religion, human rights and civil justice in Israel and throughout the Middle East. Beyond
                            establishing the Jerusalem Institute of Justice, Calev Michael has worked for many years as
                            a partner at Yehuda Raveh & Co. Law Offices, a leading firm founded by Gideon Hausner,
                            Israel's State Prosecutor in the Adolf Eichman trial. Calev Michael is a Board of Governors
                            Member and activist of the International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists, an
                            organization combatting racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, Holocaust denial, and negation of
                            the State of Israel. He is a regular contributor to the op-ed pages of major Israeli
                            newspapers and news websites and makes frequent appearances on Israeli and international
                            television programs as a human rights current events analyst. Calev Michael also leads a new
                            social movement in Israel which advances the diplomatic and security position of Israel in
                            the international community, as well as the social and economic situation in Israel, with an
                            emphasis on its peripheral communities. Calev Michael's movement constitutes a bridge
                            between the nation of Israel, the Jewish people and Christian communities worldwide.

                                            <p>Rabbi Capers Funnye is first cousin to Michelle Obama and Chief Rabbi of
                                                one of America’s largest Black synagogues, the Beth Shalom B’nai Zaken
                                                Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation in Chicago. Rabbi Funnye was raised in a
                                                conventional Christian household during the turbulent 1970s, an era
                                                charged with Afrocentrism and cultural separatism. Dissatisfied with
                                                what he considered a “slave master imposed religion,” he converted to
                                                Conservative Judaism. Rabbi Funnye represents the small number of
                                                African American Jews who actively participate in the mainstream Jewish
                                                community while treasuring their Black heritage. He consults for
                                                institutions including The DuSable Museum of African American History,

                                                poignant wisdom and unconventional approach to life is

                                            <p>Judge Kermit V. Lipez is the son of Jewish-Russian immigrants who raised
                                                him with a strong sense of duty to meaningfully contribute tosociety. He
                                                is also my dad's first cousin whom I have always referred to as "uncle."
                                                Following graduation from Yale Law School in 1967, Judge Lipez joined
                                                the U.S. Department of Justice Honors Program as a staff attorney in the
                                                Civil Rights Division from 1967 to 1968. It was there that he learned
                                                “...how complicated these issues were” and how “members of the White
                                                community who wanted to do something about civil rights issues had to be
                                                sensitive to how they would go about doing it.” He continued to become a
                                                successful and influential civil rights activist, not unlike many young
                                                Jewish lawyers of the era. Between 1970 and 1998, Lipez worked as a
                                                legislative aide for U.S. Senator Edmond Muskie, in private practice in
                                                Maine, and as a Justice of the Maine Superior Court until his
                                                appointment to the First Circuit Court of Appeals by President Bill

                                                Judge Lipez looks back on his years in the Civil Rights Movement as
                                                formative. As his nephew, I can add that they were also formative to my
                                                own decision to become a civil and human rights lawyer and activist.

                                                Illinois. He earned a PhD in philosophy from Yale University and was
                                                ordained by the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati. Throughout the
                                                1960s, Rabbi Marx fought for civil rights alongside Dr. Martin Luther
                                                King, marching by his side in Chicago and Alabama. Since then, Rabbi
                                                Marx has continued to pursue justice and civil rights, leading the

                                                with Dr. Martin Luther King shed light on the profound alliance the

                                                and helping disenfranchised communities in the face of persecution
                                                should motivate everyone to fight for civil rights in their own
                                                communities.</p>

                                            <p>Rabbi Herman Schaalman is the Rabbi Emeritus at Congregation Emanuel in
                                                Chicago and former president of the Central Conference of American
                                                Rabbis, the highest rabbinical position in the United States. He is a
                                                true pioneer of interfaith dialogue in Chicago and the nation, known
                                                widely for his eulogy at the funeral of his close friend, Cardinal
                                                Joseph Bernadin. Born in Munich to a traditional Jewish family,
                                                Schaalman came to the United States on a scholarship to Hebrew Union
                                                College in 1935. His family immigrated to Brazil after his father was
                                                released from Dachau. His intimate knowledge of the horrors of the
                                                Holocaust and anti-Semitism provided a foundation for a rebirth of
                                                Schaalman’s faith, giving him a lifelong passion to know God and other
                                                human beings on a remarkable new level.</p>
                                            <p>Rabbi Schaalman’s participation in the Civil Rights Movement and early
                                                participation in the JCUA caused many Black leaders—such as Rabbi
                                                Funnye—to name him as one of the more influential individuals in their
                                                lives. To this day, Rabbi Schaalman continues to be a civil rights
                                                activist. His personal recollections of meetings with Nation of Islam
                                                leader, Louis Farrakhan, give scope to his work in interfaith dialogue
                                                and anti-Semitism in the United States.</p>

                                                observed Shabbat and the High Holy Days. The fusion of her African

                                                contrary to human nature to be apathetic—Chloe boldly stepped onto the

                                                in Northern California. Born in Little Rock, Arkansas, and raised in
                                                California, Pastor Washington is the grandson of a sharecropper in the
                                                segregated South. His parents instilled in him a deep pride and respect
                                                of his African American heritage. His Baptist roots sparked an interest
                                                in the modern nation of Israel that culminated in a journey to Israel in
                                                the early 1990s to better understand the foundation of his Christian
                                                faith. As Dumisani studied the Jewish Diaspora, he became intrigued by
                                                Israel’s multi-ethnic identity and the return of the Diaspora from
                                                Ethiopia, India/ Burma, Kaifeng, and other parts the world. His in-depth
                                                examination of this phenomenon caused him to develop a vision to
                                                strengthen solidarity between the Jewish state and communities of

                                            <p>Rabbi Michael R. Zedek is a passionate activist, scholar, teacher, and
                                                the Senior Rabbi of Congregation Emanuel in Chicago, Illinois.
                                                Previously, he served as the Chief Executive Officer of the Jewish
                                                Federation of Cincinnati and the Chief Rabbi of Temple B’nai Jehudah in
                                                Kansas City, Missouri. Rabbi Zedek is deeply involved in civic affairs
                                                and has served on numerous boards of national and international
                                                institutions. A recipient of numerous awards, including the Danforth
                                                Graduate Fellowship for outstanding teaching and a Fulbright-Hays Grant,
                                                Zedek’s years instructing at a predominantly Black college helped him
                                                realize that he had not been living out the ideals he so passionately
                                                taught. Zedek contends that his transformation lay in his ability to
                                                recognize that connecting with his Jewish roots—while handing
                                                educational ownership over to the Black community—was not
                                                mutually-exclusive with his advocacy of African American economic and
                                                social rights in the United States. </p>
